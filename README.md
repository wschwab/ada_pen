## Ada Pen
##### A little repo for playing around in Ada

I wanted to play around with Ada a bit, so in the spirit of some of my other repos, I decided to put my little baby steps in one place.

There's not much to see here. As of this writing (Apr 24, 2021), everything here are snippets from Ada Core's [Introduction to Ada](https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-ada/index.html), except for `gol`, which is a Game of Life implementation taken from [Tsoding](https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding) ([YouTube vod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJAuyoDt03A), [Code](https://github.com/tsoding/ada-gol/blob/master/gol.adb).
